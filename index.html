    <h1>On wormholes with funny shapes</h1>
    <img src="images/wormholes.png">
    <p>
      That's an image of two donut-shaped wormholes connected to each other. But
      what does that mean, exactly - and how did I cajole a computer into making an image
      of such a thing?
    </p>
    <h2>Mathematical background</h2>
    <p>
      To get a clear idea of what's happening here, it's necessary to go over some of the mathematical technology involved.
      Aside from tools used in all fields of mathematics, our tech falls under the subject of <i>differential geometry.</i>
      The specific constructs we'll need are
      <ul>
        <li>manifolds and charts on them,</li>
        <li>quotient spaces,</li>
        <li>partitions of unity,</li>
        <li>metrics and inverse metrics,</li>
        <li>pushforwards and pullbacks,</li>
        <li>fibre bundles.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Manifolds and charts</h3>
    <p><b>Basic examples:</b> \(n\)-dimensional real space \(\mathbb{R}^n\), \(n\)-dimensional sphere \(S^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid \norm{x} = 1\}\)</p>
    <p>
      A manifold is a geometric space that "locally looks like" \(n\)-dimensional real space, and has some additional properties to make sure
      it's well-behaved. What does it mean to "locally look like" \(n\)-dimensional real space?


    </p>
    <h2>The construction itself</h2>
    <p>
      First off, for pairs of real numbers \(0 < r < R\), we'll define \(T(R,r)\) to be the torus with major radius \(R\) and minor radius \(r\),
      sitting at the origin of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and whose axis of symmetry is the \(z\)-axis.
      For triples of real numbers \(0 < r_1 < r_2 < R\), we define \(S(R,r_1,r_2)\) as the closed region bounded between the two tori
      \(T(R, r_1)\) and \(T(R, r_2)\). We'll occasionally call this a <i>(toroidal) shell</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For utility, we define \(\pi_{xy}\) to be the projection of a point onto the \(xy\)-plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's possible to parameterize \(T(R,r)\) in the form \(R(\cos(\phi), \sin(\phi), 0) + r(\cos(\psi)\cos(\phi), \cos(\psi)\sin(\phi), \sin(\psi))\)
      for two angles \(\phi, \psi\). Given a point \(x \in T(R,r)\), the component \(R(\cos(\phi), \sin(\phi), 0)\) is equal to
      \(R\frac{\pi_{xy} x}{\norm{\pi_{xy} x}}\). We define \(c(x)\) to equal this component, and \(\delta(x) = x - c(x)\).
    </p>
    <p>
      We can think of \(S(R,r_1,r_2)\) as a version of the product space \(T(R,r_1) \times [0,1]\).
      Given a point \(x \in T(R,r_1)\), the fibre attached to \(x\) consists of points of the form \(c(x) + (1-\lambda)\delta(x) + \lambda \frac{r_2}{r_1} \delta(x)\)
      for \(\lambda \in [0,1]\).
    </p>


    <h2>Toward a wormhole</h2>
    <p>
      The broad idea of a wormhole is that of a tunnel between two spaces. To make one, you cut similar holes
      out of each space, and glue the edges of the holes to each other. This sounds simple enough, but you
      will rapidly run into trouble if you try to do this naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose our two spaces are each just a copy of 3D space, and the hole we cut is a ball of unit radius.
      To glue the boundary of one hole to the other, we send each point to the one with the same coordinates
      in the other copy. Is that good enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost. The resulting space will have a smooth structure, but in some sense it won't be compatible
      with the metric of each of the two 3D spaces. If we take a point on the boundary of the hole
      and shoot a ray tangentially along the hole, there won't be a consistent way to answer which
      side of the hole it ends up on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to think of the issue is that finite segments of geodesics should change smoothly
      as the initial conditions of the geodesic do. If I shoot a finite ray that just grazes the hole
      and terminates somewhere, then any small rotation of my initial aim should move the termination
      point only a little. But a small rotation from a grazing ray will ensure the ray continues
      on one side of the hole, and the opposite rotation ensures it continues on the opposite side.
      In either case, the ray will be proceeding away from the hole at the same speed, so the separation
      between the endpoints can't be much less than some constant times the total length of the ray,
      regardless of how small the rotation was. This means that rotating our aim results in a discontinuous
      jump in the endpoint of our ray, so geodesics don't behave correctly in our glued space.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't a huge problem for making images, since rays are unlikely to hit the edge of a wormhole
      anyway, but the image will be discontinuous and you'll run into other problems - for example, for
      any physical body that partly hits the hole, the derivative of its internal forces will be discontinuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if we want to glue two Riemannian manifolds together, we need to glue a bit more than just their boundaries -
      we need some overlap, so we can gradually transition from one metric to the other. To accomplish this,
      we pick a neighborhood of the boundary for each manifold, and we glue those together. What does this look
      like in practice?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's return again to the example of two 3D spaces with holes in the shape of unit balls.
      Let's call one space \(A\) and the other \(B\). In \(A\), we'll consider the shell
      of points around the hole whose distance from the origin is in the segment \([1,2]\),
      and we'll glue this to the analogous shell in \(B\) by <i>reversing</i> each segment.
      The exact function used to reverse a segment is not terribly important — one option
      is to send a point \(p\) at distance \(r\) from the origin to a point at distance
      \(3-r\) that lies along the same ray from the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a moment to imagine a point in \(A\) falling into the shell around the hole. As
      soon as it hits distance \(2\) from the origin, its mirror image appears in \(B\) at
      distance \(1\). As the point sinks further into the shell in \(A\), its image in \(B\)
      starts coming up and out of the shell. Once the point has hit the hole at radius \(1\)
      in \(A\), its image in \(B\) is at distance \(2\) from the origin. Then the point
      disappears in \(A\), and exits the shell in \(B\).
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to understand that after the gluing has been performed, the two shells
      in \(A\) and \(B\) are just two different maps of the same underlying territory. When
      we have a point in the shell in \(A\), its image in \(B\) is <i>really</i> the exact
      same point, just viewed from a different angle. If you've ever looked in an atlas
      of the Earth, different maps will have some amount of overlap, and you could spot
      the same city on two different maps — same thing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we perform the gluing in the way I've described, something unfortunate will happen.
      If we have a left hand in \(A\), it falls into the hole and passes into \(B\), it will
      become a right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spaces \(A\) and \(B\) are not connected in any way other than through this wormhole,
      this is a silly thing to worry about, because we could always mirror our perspective on \(B\)
      and the hole will seem to preserve handedness. If we're connecting a space to itself
      with a wormhole, then this becomes a meaningful problem: if we have two left hands
      next to each other, and one goes off and does a round trip through a wormhole, it will
      return as a right hand <i>as compared to</i> the left hand that stood still. When
      \(A\) and \(B\) have no connections other than one wormhole, no such roundtrip is possible,
      so no such comparison can be made, and the issue of reversing handedness is sort of fictitious.
