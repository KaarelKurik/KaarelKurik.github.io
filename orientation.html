<h1>Primer on orientation</h1>
<p>
    An orientation of a geometric space is a way of assigning a consistent
    "handedness" to the space. That's a little vague, so it demands some elaboration.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of orientation arises from the observation that some objects
    are different from their mirror images, in the sense that after you mirror the
    object, there's no way to rotate or translate it so that the mirror image overlaps
    with the original. The classic example of this is the left hand as compared
    to the right, which is why orientation is often called handedness, or chirality
    ('handedness' in Greek-ish English).
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that in ordinary Euclidean space, regardless of how many dimensions
    you're working in, there's only two distinct orientations. The formal fact
    corresponding to this intuitive fact is that the isometry group of Euclidean space
    has two connected components â€” if you restrict your attention to linear isometries,
    these will be the isometries with determinant 1 (which perserve orientation) and
    those with determinant -1 (which reverse orientation). There is a continuous path
    between any two isometries that preserve orientation, and between any two that
    reverse it, but there's no continuous way to go from an isometry that preserves
    orientation to one that reverses it, without passing through non-isometries.
</p>
<p>
    As far as I know, that there are only two orientations is true in general spaces
    and not just Euclidean ones, but as
    the geometric interpretation of our space becomes more obscure, so does the geometric
    meaning of orientation.
</p>
<p>
    On differentiable manifolds, an orientation can be thought of as a global section of
    the orientation bundle.
</p>
<h2>Manifold, bundle, section, orientation</h2>
<p>
    I assume you know what vector spaces, bases, equivalence classes, \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and
    continuity are.
</p>
<p>
    For a finite dimensional vector space, we say that two bases have equal orientation
    when the linear map sending one to the other has positive determinant. This splits
    the collection of all bases into two equivalence classes, and each of these equivalence
    classes is an orientation of V.

    (Alternatively, an orientation of V is a choice of which equivalence class is positive,
    which is not precisely the same thing.)
</p>
<p>
    For an example, consider \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with basis vectors \(i,j\). If the shorter
    path for rotating \(i\) to align with \(j\) goes counterclockwise, then the basis is
    positively oriented (by convention). Otherwise the basis is negatively oriented.
